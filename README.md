## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/expanse-project/go-expanse/wiki/Building-Expanse)
on the wiki.

Building gexp requires both a Go and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make gexp

## Executables

Go Expanse comes with several wrappers/executables found in
[the `cmd` directory](https://github.com/expanse-project/go-expanse/tree/develop/cmd):

* `gexp` Expanse CLI (expanse command line interface client)
* `bootnode` runs a bootstrap node for the Discovery Protocol
* `exptest` test tool which runs with the [tests](https://github.com/expanse-project/tests) suite:
  `/path/to/test.json > exptest --test BlockTests --stdin`.
* `evm` is a generic Expanse Virtual Machine: `evm -code 60ff60ff -gas
  10000 -price 0 -dump`. See `-h` for a detailed description.
* `disasm` disassembles EVM code: `echo "6001" | disasm`
* `rlpdump` prints RLP structures

## Command line options

`gexp` can be configured via command line options, environment variables and config files.

To get the options available:

    geth help

For further details on options, see the [wiki](https://github.com/expanse-project/go-expanse/wiki/Command-Line-Options)
